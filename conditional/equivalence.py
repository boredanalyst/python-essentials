## Equivalence operators compare two values and whether they are equal.

fText = "Hello"
gText = "HELLO"

if fText == gText:
    print("The values are equal.")
else:
    print("The values are not equal.")
    ## The values are not completely equivalent because equivalence is case-sensitive.
